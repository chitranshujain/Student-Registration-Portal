# 📝 Student Registration Portal (HTML Only)

This is a **fully functional Student Registration Portal** built using **only HTML** — no CSS, no JavaScript. It is developed as a comprehensive demonstration of **all major HTML concepts and elements**, making it an ideal project for HTML learning, revision, and reference.

## 📌 About the Project

The portal showcases a structured and semantic layout that includes:

- 🧱 Use of **semantic tags** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- 📝 Rich **form elements**:
  - Text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, date and file inputs
  - Fieldsets and legends for grouping form data
  - Proper labeling with `<label for="">` attributes
- 🔗 **Internal and external linking**
- 🖼️ Use of images via `<img>`
- 🎯 Anchor tags and navigation using `<nav>` and `<a>`
- 🧭 Table structure and list formatting
- 🔍 Input validation attributes (like `required`, `pattern`, `maxlength`, etc.)
- 💬 Commenting, meta tags, and document structure
- 🔤 Accessibility and best practices with alt texts and title attributes

## ✅ Key Highlights

- Pure **HTML5** — No CSS, No JavaScript
- Designed to demonstrate **complete HTML knowledge**
- Structured for **clarity, accessibility**, and semantic correctness
- Ideal for **beginners**, educators, or anyone looking to **practice or teach** HTML fundamentals

## 📂 Files
